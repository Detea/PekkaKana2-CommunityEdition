To add a new episode, just download the zip file and extract it to its respective path inside "res/".

It can be started with the "dev" argument to start the
cheats and "test" following by the episode and level to
open directly on the level.

This example starts the level13.map on dev mode:
```
./PK2 dev test rooster\ island\ 2/level13.map
```

To start the game in windowed mode, start it with the "windowed" argument:
```
./PK2 windowed
```

To start it without sound and override the games settings, use the following argument:
```
./PK2 nosound
```

Of course all these arguments can be combined.
